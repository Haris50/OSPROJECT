# OSPROJECT
OBJECTIVE:


Our project will mainly focus on the differences between multithreading and multiprocessing. The performance comparison will be observed by the implementation of FOUR different series algorithms :

    1) Fibonacci Series
    2) Trag Series 
    3)  Lazy Caterer Series
    4) Catalan Series


INTRODUCTION:


Comparison will be shown on the basis of speed and input (number of elements in the series). All the above mentioned algorithms have been implemented using multithreading and multiprocessing along with the use of pipes.
